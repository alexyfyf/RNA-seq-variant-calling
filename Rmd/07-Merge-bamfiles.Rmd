# Merge bamfiles {#ch:merge-bamfiles}

In some cases the sequenced reads from one sample can be sequenced across different lanes and the aligned bamfiles need to be merged. `sambamba merge` can be used for this. I created a wrapper function for it even though it assumes that the files from the same sample have a common *SampleName*. The function will merge together all bamfiles containing *SampleName*.


```{bash eval=FALSE}
../functions/merge_runs.sh SampleName ./star_2pass
```
